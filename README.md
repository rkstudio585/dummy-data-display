This project is a sample website that displays dummy JSON data (users, products, and orders) using HTML, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. It provides a basic UI for viewing user profiles, product listings, and order details in a visually appealing format.

## ✨ Features

- 👤 **User Profiles**: View user information including name, age, email, phone numbers, and addresses.
- 🛍️ **Product Catalog**: Browse product details including name, description, price, stock, and ratings.
- 📦 **Order Details**: See orders placed by users, with details on each item and total cost.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For page structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the page with a responsive, modern design.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: For dynamically displaying the JSON data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dummy-data-display.git
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser to view the website.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main file containing HTML structure, embedded JSON data, and scripts.
- **Tailwind CSS CDN**: For page styling.
- **jQuery CDN**: For easier JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## 🧩 How It Works

- The JSON data is embedded directly in the HTML file within a JavaScript object.
